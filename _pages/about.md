## Welcome to My Tech Universe! üöÄüåê

I'm a curious mind who loves pushing the limits of robotics, embedded systems, and intelligent software. Whether it's designing a gripper that seamlessly switches between grasping and throwing, optimizing a robot‚Äôs audio for a more interactive experience, or fine-tuning real-time control systems, I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions. Every project is a chance to innovate, explore, and bring futuristic ideas to life!

Currently, I‚Äôm an **Embedded Software Engineer at Miko**, where I work on making robots smarter and more interactive. Before this, I was a **Research Assistant at the Robotics Research Centre, IIIT Hyderabad**, where I dived deep into robotic manipulation, trajectory optimization, and hardware-software integration.

I hold an **MS by Research in Electrical and Computer Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad** and a **BE in Electronics and Communication Engineering from ANITS**. My research has led me to develop novel gripper mechanisms, refine parameter identification techniques, and optimize motion planning. My work has been published in *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)* and *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics* and even featured in *IEEE Spectrum*.

Beyond research, I've explored various roles‚Äî**consultant engineer, AI prompt engineer, and software developer**‚Äîtackling challenges across robotics, automation, and machine learning. My projects range from building intelligent robotic end-effectors to optimizing embedded systems and applying deep learning for 3D object recognition.

I‚Äôm always excited to collaborate and explore new frontiers in robotics, software, and intelligent systems. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together! üöÄ
