## Welcome to My Tech Universe! üöÄüåê

I'm a curious mind who loves pushing the limits of robotics, embedded systems, and intelligent software. Whether it's designing a gripper that seamlessly switches between grasping and throwing, optimizing a robot‚Äôs audio for a more interactive experience, or fine-tuning real-time control systems, I thrive on turning complex challenges into elegant solutions. Every project is a chance to innovate, explore, and bring futuristic ideas to life!

Currently, I‚Äôm an **Embedded Software Engineer at Miko**, where I work on making robots smarter and more interactive. Before this, I was a **Research Assistant at the Robotics Research Centre, IIIT Hyderabad**, where I dived deep into robotic manipulation, trajectory optimization, and hardware-software integration.

I hold an **MS by Research in Electrical and Computer Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad** and a **BE in Electronics and Communication Engineering from ANITS**. My research has led me to develop novel gripper mechanisms, refine parameter identification techniques, and optimize motion planning. My work has been published in *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)* and *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics* and even featured in *IEEE Spectrum*.

Beyond research, I've explored various roles‚Äî**consultant engineer, AI prompt engineer, and software developer**‚Äîtackling challenges across robotics, automation, and machine learning. My projects range from building intelligent robotic end-effectors to optimizing embedded systems and applying deep learning for 3D object recognition.

I‚Äôm always excited to collaborate and explore new frontiers in robotics, software, and intelligent systems. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together! üöÄ

## Abstract of Published Paper

Drones and mobile manipulators that can throw objects in addition to picking and placing them can be highly useful in industrial automation, warehouse environments, search and rescue operations, and sports training. However, predominant end-effectors primarily cater to grasping functions, neglecting the throwing aspect. Currently, throwing is achieved by fast whole-arm motion (Zeng et al., 2020), an approach that raises concerns regarding safety and energy efficiency. Additionally, targeted throwing poses several challenges due to the uncertainties in model parameters and unmodelled dynamics. This letter presents a new end-effector mechanism that can grasp and then place or throw an object using stored elastic energy. The instantaneous release of this stored energy propels the grasped object into projectile motion, facilitating its placement in a desired target location which can lie beyond the reachable workspace of the robot arm. We describe the mechanical design of the end-effector, its simulation model, a system identification method to fit model parameters, and a data-driven residual learning framework. The residual model predicts control input residuals arising from model uncertainties, improving targeted throwing accuracy even with unseen objects. Experiments conducted with our robot arm mounted end-effector show the efficacy of our end-effector mechanism and associated algorithms for targeted throwing.
