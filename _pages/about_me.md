### Welcome to My Tech Universe! üöÄüåê
Greetings! I'm Haasith Pasala, a researcher at IIIT Hyderabad, exploring the intricate world of robotics under the mentorship of Dr. Nagamanikandan Govindan. My research focuses on gripper mechanism design, blending trajectory optimization and learning techniques to unlock new dimensions of robotic manipulation.

Armed with a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad and a Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from ANITS, my academic journey reflects a passion for innovation. During my undergraduate studies, I crafted a MEMS-based wheelchair, showcasing an early commitment to cutting-edge projects.

Beyond academia, I've worn diverse hats ‚Äì teaching assistant, consultant engineer ‚Äì and my work has earned recognition in IEEE Spectrum. My expertise spans robotic manipulation, optimal control, computer vision, and mechanism design. Currently, I'm immersed in reinforcing learning techniques for robotics applications, pushing the boundaries of what machines can learn and accomplish.

In this ever-evolving landscape, I am not just a researcher; I'm a storyteller weaving tales of technology and discovery. Join me on this exciting journey where each line of code and every mechanical creation adds to the unfolding narrative of innovation in the dynamic realm of robotics and engineering.
